# Spatially-Resolved-Stochastic-Cluster-Dynamics-SRSCD-simulator-with-Qianran-Yu-
The SRSCD simulation package contains a computer code written in C++. It is an alternative mean field rate theory model that dynamically simulates microstructure (as clusters) evolutions of multi-species systems in solid materials in 1-D space. We have used the code to study Zr-H and W-H system.

****Introduction****
The SRSCD is a stochastic variant of the mean field rate theory method that is typically developed to simulate microstructure evolutions during permeation of long-term migrating elements, such as hydrogen, into metallic materials. Please see the following journal papers for detail:
