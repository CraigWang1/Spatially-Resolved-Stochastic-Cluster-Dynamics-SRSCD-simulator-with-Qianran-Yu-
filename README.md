# Spatially-Resolved-Stochastic-Cluster-Dynamics-SRSCD-simulator-with-Qianran-Yu-
The SRSCD simulation package contains a computer code written in C++. It is an alternative mean field rate theory model that dynamically simulates microstructure (as clusters) evolutions of multi-species systems in solid materials in 1-D space. We have used the code to study Zr-H and W-H system.
